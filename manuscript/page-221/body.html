You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together. Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time? Do you suppose him really indifferent to her?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I cannot think that. He must and does love her I am sure.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such indifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to him.&quot;</p></div> </div>
