<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I am so glad to meet you;&quot; said Miss Steele, taking her familiarly by the arm&#x2014;&quot;for I wanted to see you of all things in the world.&quot; And then lowering her voice, &quot;I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it. Is she angry?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not at all, I believe, with you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is a good thing. And Lady Middleton, is SHE angry?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I cannot suppose it possible that she should be.&quot;</p></div> </div>
