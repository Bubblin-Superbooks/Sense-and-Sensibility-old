The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh,&quot; cried Marianne, &quot;with what transporting sensation have I formerly seen them fall! How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them driven in showers about me by the wind! What feelings have they, the season, the air altogether inspired! Now there is no one to regard them. They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much as possible from the sight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is not every one,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;who has your passion for dead leaves.&quot;</p></div> </div>
