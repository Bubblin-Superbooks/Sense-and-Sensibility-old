<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland. The treachery, or the folly, of my cousin&apos;s maid betrayed us. I was banished to the house of a relation far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement, till my father&apos;s point was gained. </p><p> I had depended on her fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one&#x2014;but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now to lament it. This however was not the case. </p></div> </div>
