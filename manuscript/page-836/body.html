Your business cannot be with ME. The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Had they told me,&quot; he cried with vehemence, &quot;that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil, it would not have turned me from the door. My business is with you, and only you.&quot;</p></div> </div>
