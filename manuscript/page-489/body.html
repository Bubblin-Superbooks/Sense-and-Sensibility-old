Oh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion! Happy, happy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea of what I suffer.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do you call ME happy, Marianne? Ah! if you knew!&#x2014;And can you believe me to be so, while I see you so wretched!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Forgive me, forgive me,&quot; throwing her arms round her sister&apos;s neck; &quot;I know you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet you are&#x2014;you must be happy; Edward loves you&#x2014;what, oh what, can do away such happiness as that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Many, many circumstances,&quot; said Elinor, solemnly.</p></div> </div>
