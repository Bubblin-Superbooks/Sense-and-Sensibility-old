<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our lives. I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation. I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs. Smith&apos;s grounds, or in seeing her house. They will one day be Mr. Willoughby&apos;s, and&#x2014;&quot;</p><p>&quot;If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be justified in what you have done.&quot;</p></div> </div>
