<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;I understand you.&#x2014;You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.&#x2014;For four months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.&#x2014; It was told me,&#x2014;it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph.&#x2014; This person&apos;s suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested;&#x2014;and it has not been only once;&#x2014;I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.&#x2014; I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.&#x2014;</p></div> </div>
