<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I love to be reminded of the past, Edward&#x2014;whether it be melancholy or gay, I love to recall it&#x2014;and you will never offend me by talking of former times. You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent&#x2014;some of it, at least&#x2014;my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life&#x2014;your opinion on that point is unchanged, I presume?&quot;</p></div> </div>
