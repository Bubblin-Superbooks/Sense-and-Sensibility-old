I was breakfasting at the Ellisons,&#x2014;and her letter, with some others, was brought to me there from my lodgings. It happened to catch Sophia&apos;s eye before it caught mine&#x2014;and its size, the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing altogether, immediately gave her a suspicion. </p><p> Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was, and made her more jealous than ever. Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read its contents. </p></div> </div>
