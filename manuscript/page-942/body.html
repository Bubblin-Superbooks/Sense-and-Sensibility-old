<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Had I died,&#x2014;in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my friend, my sister!&#x2014;You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!&#x2014;How should I have lived in YOUR remembrance!&#x2014;My mother too! How could you have consoled her!&#x2014;I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself. </p><p> Whenever I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing indulged. Every body seemed injured by me. The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful contempt. To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very attention.&#x2014;To John, to Fanny,&#x2014;yes, even to them, little as they deserve, I had given less than their due. </p></div> </div>
