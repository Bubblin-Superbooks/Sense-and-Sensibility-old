<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Marianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining with them. Elinor even advised her against it. But &quot;no, she would go down; she could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less.&quot; Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive, though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner, said no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could, while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it. </p></div> </div>
