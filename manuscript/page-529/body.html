No positive engagement indeed! after taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter!&quot;</p><p>Elinor, for her sister&apos;s sake, could not press the subject farther, and she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby&apos;s; since, though Marianne might lose much, he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth.
