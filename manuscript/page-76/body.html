<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved. &quot;Dear, dear Norland!&quot; said Marianne, as she wandered alone before the house, on the last evening of their being there; &quot;when shall I cease to regret you!&#x2014;when learn to feel a home elsewhere!&#x2014;Oh! happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!&#x2014;And you, ye well-known trees!&#x2014;but you will continue the same.&#x2014;No leaf will decay because we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!&#x2014;No; you will continue the same; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade!&#x2014;But who will remain to enjoy you?&quot; </p></div> </div>
