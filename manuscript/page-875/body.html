<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton, and when he saw who I was&#x2014;for the first time these two months&#x2014;he spoke to me.&#x2014;That he had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen without surprise or resentment. Now, however, his good-natured, honest, stupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern for your sister, could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to&#x2014;though probably he did not think it WOULD&#x2014;vex me horridly. </p><p> As bluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland&#x2014;a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent&#x2014;the Palmers are all gone off in a fright, &amp;c.&#x2014;I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John. </p></div> </div>
