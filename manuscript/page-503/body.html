I have been expecting to hear from you, and still more to see you, every hour of the day. </p><p> Pray call again as soon as possible, and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain. You had better come earlier another time, because we are generally out by one. We were last night at Lady Middleton&apos;s, where there was a dance. I have been told that you were asked to be of the party. </p><p class="closing">&quot;M.D.&quot;</p></div> </div>
