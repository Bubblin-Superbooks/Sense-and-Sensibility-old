She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on, she left no creature behind, from whom it would give her a moment&apos;s regret to be divided for ever, she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution of Lucy&apos;s friendship, she was grateful for bringing her sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage, and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring Marianne&apos;s peace of mind, and confirming her own. </p></div> </div>
