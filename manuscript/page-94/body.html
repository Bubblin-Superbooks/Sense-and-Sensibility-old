Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round, while Sir John&apos;s independent employments were in existence only half the time. </p><p> Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and of all her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties. But Sir John&apos;s satisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisier they were the better was he pleased. </p></div> </div>
