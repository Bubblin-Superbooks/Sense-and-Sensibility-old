<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly DO&#x2014;that after what has passed&#x2014;your coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself upon my notice, requires a very particular excuse.&#x2014;What is it, that you mean by it?&quot;&#x2014;</p><p>&quot;I mean,&quot;&#x2014;said he, with serious energy&#x2014;&quot;if I can, to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW. I mean to offer some kind of explanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma&#x2014;from your sister.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is this the real reason of your coming?&quot;</p></div> </div>
