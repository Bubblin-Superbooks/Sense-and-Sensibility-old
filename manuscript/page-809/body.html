I have good reason to think&#x2014;indeed I have it from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it&#x2014;but I have it from the very best authority&#x2014;not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself&#x2014;but her daughter DID, and I have it from her&#x2014;That in short, whatever objections there might be against a certain&#x2014;a certain connection&#x2014;you understand me&#x2014;it would have been far preferable to her, it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does. </p></div> </div>
