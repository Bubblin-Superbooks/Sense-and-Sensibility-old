<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, no affection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find it a difficult matter.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I shall not attempt it. I have no wish to be distinguished; and have every reason to hope I never shall. Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You have no ambition, I well know. Your wishes are all moderate.&quot;</p><p>&quot;As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe. I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be in my own way. Greatness will not make me so.&quot;</p></div> </div>
