<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Remember,&quot; cried Willoughby, &quot;from whom you received the account. Could it be an impartial one? I acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me. I do not mean to justify myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge&#x2014;that because she was injured she was irreproachable, and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint. </p><p> If the violence of her passions, the weakness of her understanding&#x2014;I do not mean, however, to defend myself. Her affection for me deserved better treatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any return. I wish&#x2014;I heartily wish it had never been. </p></div> </div>
