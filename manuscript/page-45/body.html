<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address. He was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing. He was too diffident to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome, his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart. </p><p> His understanding was good, and his education had given it solid improvement. But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him distinguished&#x2014;as&#x2014;they hardly knew what. They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other. </p></div> </div>
