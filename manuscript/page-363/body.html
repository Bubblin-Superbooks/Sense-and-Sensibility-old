<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I heard from him just before I left Exeter;&quot; taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor. &quot;You know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is; but that is not written so well as usual.&#x2014;He was tired, I dare say, for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible.&quot; </p><p> Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt no longer. This picture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been accidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward&apos;s gift; but a correspondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a positive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few moments, she was almost overcome&#x2014;her heart sunk within her, and she could hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, that her success was speedy, and for the time complete. </p></div> </div>
