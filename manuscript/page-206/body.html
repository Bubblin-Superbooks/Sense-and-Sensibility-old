<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you. Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin, by sending me on business to London. I have just received my dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;To London!&#x2014;and are you going this morning?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Almost this moment.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is very unfortunate. But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;&#x2014;and her business will not detain you from us long I hope.&quot;</p><p>He coloured as he replied, &quot;You are very kind, but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately. My visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth.&quot;</p></div> </div>
