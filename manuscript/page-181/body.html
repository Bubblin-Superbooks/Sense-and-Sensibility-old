You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I wish it could be so easily settled. But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day!&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you would but let us know what your business is,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, &quot;we might see whether it could be put off or not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You would not be six hours later,&quot; said Willoughby, &quot;if you were to defer your journey till our return.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I cannot afford to lose ONE hour.&quot;&#x2014;</p></div> </div>
