<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When I came to you last week and found you alone, I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to do when it WAS known. My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then; but now you will comprehend it. To suffer you all to be so deceived; to see your sister&#x2014;but what could I do? I had no hope of interfering with success; and sometimes I thought your sister&apos;s influence might yet reclaim him. </p></div> </div>
