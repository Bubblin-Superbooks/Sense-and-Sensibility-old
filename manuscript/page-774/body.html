And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life, and I wish you joy of it with all my heart.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you, ma&apos;am,&quot; said Elinor. &quot;It is a matter of great joy to me; and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly. There are not many men who would act as he has done. Few people who have so compassionate a heart! I never was more astonished in my life.&quot;</p></div> </div>
