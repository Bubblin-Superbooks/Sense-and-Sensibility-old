<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Colonel Brandon give ME a living!&#x2014;Can it be possible?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; replied he, with sudden consciousness, &quot;not to find it in YOU; for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it all.&#x2014;I feel it&#x2014;I would express it if I could&#x2014;but, as you well know, I am no orator.&quot;</p><p> &quot;You are very much mistaken. I do assure you that you owe it entirely, at least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon&apos;s discernment of it. I have had no hand in it. I did not even know, till I understood his design, that the living was vacant; nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift. </p></div> </div>
