By whom can he have been instigated?&quot;</p><p> &quot;By all the world, rather than by his own heart. I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty. This woman of whom he writes&#x2014;whoever she be&#x2014;or any one, in short, but your own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to bely me. </p><p>Elinor would not contend, and only replied, &quot;Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph, my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits. It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence.&quot;</p></div> </div>
