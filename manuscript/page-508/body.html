And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine! And the dried cherries too! Lord! nothing seems to do her any good.

Did you ever see her? a smart, stylish girl they say, but not handsome. I remember her aunt very well, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man. But the family are all rich together.
