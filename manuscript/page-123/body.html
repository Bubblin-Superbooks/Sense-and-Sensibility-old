I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit is intended; and &apos;setting one&apos;s cap at a man,&apos; or &apos;making a conquest,&apos; are the most odious of all. Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity.&quot;</p><p>Sir John did not much understand this reproof; but he laughed as heartily as if he did, and then replied,</p><p>&quot;Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other. Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worth setting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles.&quot;</p></div> </div>
