She vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me again, so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we are as good friends as ever. </p><p> Look, she made me this bow to my hat, and put in the feather last night. There now, YOU are going to laugh at me too. But why should not I wear pink ribbons? I do not care if it IS the Doctor&apos;s favourite colour. I am sure, for my part, I should never have known he DID like it better than any other colour, if he had not happened to say so. </p></div> </div>
