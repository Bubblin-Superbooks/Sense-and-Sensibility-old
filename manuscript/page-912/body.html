<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I considered the past: I saw in my own behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of kindness to others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave. </p><p> My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong. Had I died,&#x2014;it would have been self-destruction. I did not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such feelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,&#x2014;wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once. </p></div> </div>
