<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her, is not to be described. While she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!&#x2014;such a suspicion could never have entered her head! If she suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in THAT quarter. </p><p> &apos;THERE, to be sure,&apos; said she, &apos;I might have thought myself safe.&apos; She was quite in an agony. We consulted together, however, as to what should be done, and at last she determined to send for Edward. He came. But I am sorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments, and Fanny&apos;s entreaties, was of no avail. </p></div> </div>
