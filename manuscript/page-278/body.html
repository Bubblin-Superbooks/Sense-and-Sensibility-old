Some inconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it&#x2014;you would not be able to give them so much of your time. </p><p> &quot;I do assure you,&quot; he replied, &quot;that I have long thought on this point, as you think now. It has been, and is, and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing like independence. </p></div> </div>
