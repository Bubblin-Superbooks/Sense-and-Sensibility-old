But what was that, when such friends were to be met?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perhaps, Miss Marianne,&quot; cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on her, &quot;you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have no mind to keep them, little as well as great.&quot;</p><p>Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting; for she calmly replied,</p><p> &quot;Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street. And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement, however minute, and however it may make against his interest or pleasure. He is the most fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish, of any body I ever saw. </p></div> </div>
