Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty. He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad, has read, and has a thinking mind. I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature.&quot; </p><p>&quot;That is to say,&quot; cried Marianne contemptuously, &quot;he has told you, that in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are troublesome.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such inquiries, but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed.&quot;</p></div> </div>
