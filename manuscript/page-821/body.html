<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne&apos;s complaint more serious than Elinor, now looked very grave on Mr. Harris&apos;s report, and confirming Charlotte&apos;s fears and caution, urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood. </p><p> Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and within an hour after Mr. Harris&apos;s arrival, she set off, with her little boy and his nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer&apos;s, who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised, at her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her. </p></div> </div>
