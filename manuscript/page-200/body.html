<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than Willoughby&apos;s behaviour. To Marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover&apos;s heart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother. The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his favourite pointer at her feet. </p></div> </div>
