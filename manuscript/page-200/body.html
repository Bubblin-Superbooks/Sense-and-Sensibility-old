<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood&apos;s happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as perfect with him.</p><p>&quot;What!&quot; he exclaimed&#x2014;&quot;Improve this dear cottage! No. THAT I will never consent to. Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch to its size, if my feelings are regarded.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do not be alarmed,&quot; said Miss Dashwood, &quot;nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it.&quot;</p></div> </div>
