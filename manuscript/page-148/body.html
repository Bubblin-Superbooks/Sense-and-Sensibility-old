She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor&apos;s memory been equal to her means of improvement, she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings&apos;s last illness, and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died. </p><p> Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent.

Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired. </p></div> </div>
