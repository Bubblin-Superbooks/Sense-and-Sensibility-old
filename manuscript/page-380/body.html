The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one novelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and while they remained there, she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy&apos;s attention to attempt it. </p><p>&quot;I am glad,&quot; said Lady Middleton to Lucy, &quot;you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria&apos;s basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight. And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and then I hope she will not much mind it.&quot;</p></div> </div>
