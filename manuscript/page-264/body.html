<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;It is very true,&quot; said Marianne, &quot;that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon. Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was. I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning.&quot; </p><p> &quot;I am convinced,&quot; said Edward, &quot;that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel. But, in return, your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess. I like a fine prospect, but not on picturesque principles. I do not like crooked, twisted, blasted trees. </p></div> </div>
