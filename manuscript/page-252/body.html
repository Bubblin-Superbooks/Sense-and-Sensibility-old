<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Strange that it would!&quot; cried Marianne. &quot;What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Grandeur has but little,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;but wealth has much to do with it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Elinor, for shame!&quot; said Marianne, &quot;money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it. Beyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Elinor, smiling, &quot;we may come to the same point. YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and without them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting. Your ideas are only more noble than mine. Come, what is your competence?&quot;</p></div> </div>
