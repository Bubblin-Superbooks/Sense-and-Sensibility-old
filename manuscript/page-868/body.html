<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered, what I have been telling you?&#x2014;Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours. You tell me that she has forgiven me already. Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my present feelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more gentle, less dignified, forgiveness. </p><p>&quot;I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called, your justification. But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now, nor how you heard of her illness.&quot;</p></div> </div>
