<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> My mother was quite sick of it. Her income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at my mother&apos;s disposal, without any restriction whatever. It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world.&quot; </p><p>&quot;It is certainly an unpleasant thing,&quot; replied Mr. Dashwood, &quot;to have those kind of yearly drains on one&apos;s income. One&apos;s fortune, as your mother justly says, is NOT one&apos;s own. To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it takes away one&apos;s independence.&quot;</p></div> </div>
