<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Sir John, could not have thought it possible. &quot;A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well! Such a good-natured fellow! He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England! It was an unaccountable business. He wished him at the devil with all his heart. </p><p> He would not speak another word to him, meet him where he might, for all the world! No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert, and they were kept watching for two hours together. Such a scoundrel of a fellow! such a deceitful dog! It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly&apos;s puppies! and this was the end of it!&quot; </p></div> </div>
