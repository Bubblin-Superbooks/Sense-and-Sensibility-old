<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing but say fine things of you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am flattered by his commendation. He seems an excellent man; and I think him uncommonly pleasing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So do I.&#x2014;He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull. Mama says HE was in love with your sister too.&#x2014; I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly ever falls in love with any body.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?&quot; said Elinor.</p></div> </div>
