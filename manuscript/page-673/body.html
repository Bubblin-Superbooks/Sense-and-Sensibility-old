<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;That is exactly what I said, my dear. &apos;Lord!&apos; says I, &apos;is Mrs. Dashwood ill?&apos; So then it all came out; and the long and the short of the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this. Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!&#x2014;There&apos;s for you, my dear!&#x2014;And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter, except Nancy!&#x2014;Could you have believed such a thing possible?&#x2014; There is no great wonder in their liking one another; but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody suspect it!&#x2014;THAT is strange!&#x2014;I never happened to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it out directly. </p></div> </div>
