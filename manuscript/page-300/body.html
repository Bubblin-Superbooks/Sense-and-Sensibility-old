<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It was quite a sudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton. He is so droll! He never tells me any thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet again in town very soon, I hope.&quot; </p><p>They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.</p><p>&quot;Not go to town!&quot; cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, &quot;I shall be quite disappointed if you do not. I could get the nicest house in the world for you, next door to ours, in Hanover-square. You must come, indeed. I am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public.&quot;</p></div> </div>
