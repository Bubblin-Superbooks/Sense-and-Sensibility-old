<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Edward talks of going to Oxford soon,&quot; said she; &quot;but now he is lodging at No. &#x2014;, Pall Mall. What an ill-natured woman his mother is, an&apos;t she? And your brother and sister were not very kind! However, I shan&apos;t say anything against them to YOU; and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot, which was more than I looked for. </p><p> And for my part, I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however, nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine out of sight. Edward have got some business at Oxford, he says; so he must go there for a time; and after THAT, as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he will be ordained. </p></div> </div>
