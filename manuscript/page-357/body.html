Our first care has been to keep the matter secret.&#x2014; You knew nothing of me, or my family, and, therefore, there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sister&apos;s suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough for his not mentioning it.&quot;</p></div> </div>
