You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give. </p><p> I call it a very fine country&#x2014;the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug&#x2014;with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there. It exactly answers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty with utility&#x2014;and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me. </p></div> </div>
