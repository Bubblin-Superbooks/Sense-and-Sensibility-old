<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It will be all to one a better match for your sister. Two thousand a year without debt or drawback&#x2014;except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I had forgot her; but she may be &apos;prenticed out at a small cost, and then what does it signify? Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and conveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner! Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there! Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a very pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for; and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike-road, so &apos;tis never dull, for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the carriages that pass along. </p></div> </div>
