<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Well,&quot;&#x2014;he replied&#x2014;&quot;once more good bye. I shall now go away and live in dread of one event.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your sister&apos;s marriage.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You are very wrong. She can never be more lost to you than she is now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But she will be gained by some one else. And if that some one should be the very he whom, of all others, I could least bear&#x2014;but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill, by shewing that where I have most injured I can least forgive. Good bye,&#x2014;God bless you!&quot;</p><p>And with these words, he almost ran out of the room.</p></div> </div>
