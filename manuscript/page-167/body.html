I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You have said so,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;almost every day since they first met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But indeed this is quite another thing.
