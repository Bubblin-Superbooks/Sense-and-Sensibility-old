<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;If this open weather holds much longer,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, when they met at breakfast the following morning, &quot;Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week; &apos;tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day&apos;s pleasure. Poor souls! I always pity them when they do; they seem to take it so much to heart.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is true,&quot; cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to the window as she spoke, to examine the day. &quot;I had not thought of that. This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country.&quot;</p><p> It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it. &quot;It is charming weather for THEM indeed,&quot; she continued, as she sat down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance. &quot;How much they must enjoy it! But&quot; (with a little return of anxiety) &quot;it cannot be expected to last long. </p></div> </div>
