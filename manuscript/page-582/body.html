<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood,&quot; said Miss Steele. &quot;I am sorry she is not well&#x2014;&quot; for Marianne had left the room on their arrival.</p><p>&quot;You are very good. My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head-aches, which make her unfit for company or conversation.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and me!&#x2014;I think she might see US; and I am sure we would not speak a word.&quot;</p><p>Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal. Her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and therefore not able to come to them.</p></div> </div>
