<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I DO beg you will favour me with your company, for I&apos;ve quite set my heart upon it. Don&apos;t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I shan&apos;t put myself at all out of my way for you. </p><p> It will only be sending Betty by the coach, and I hope I can afford THAT. We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise; and when we are in town, if you do not like to go wherever I do, well and good, you may always go with one of my daughters. </p></div> </div>
