<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I advise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage. My friend Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice, and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi&apos;s. I was to decide on the best of them. &apos;My dear Courtland,&apos; said I, immediately throwing them all into the fire, &apos;do not adopt either of them, but by all means build a cottage.&apos; And that I fancy, will be the end of it. </p><p> &quot;Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake. I was last month at my friend Elliott&apos;s, near Dartford. Lady Elliott wished to give a dance. &apos;But how can it be done?&apos; said she; &apos;my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is to be managed. </p></div> </div>
