I have been too much at my ease, too happy, too frank. I have erred against every common-place notion of decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful&#x2014;had I talked only of the weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this reproach would have been spared.&quot; </p><p>&quot;My love,&quot; said her mother, &quot;you must not be offended with Elinor&#x2014;she was only in jest. I should scold her myself, if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend.&quot;&#x2014; Marianne was softened in a moment.</p></div> </div>
