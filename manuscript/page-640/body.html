<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;My dear friend,&quot; cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, &quot;I come to talk to you of my happiness. Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars&apos;s way of treating me yesterday? So exceeding affable as she was!&#x2014;You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;&#x2014;but the very moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a fancy to me. </p><p>&quot;She was certainly very civil to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Civil!&#x2014;Did you see nothing but only civility?&#x2014; I saw a vast deal more. Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!&#x2014;No pride, no hauteur, and your sister just the same&#x2014;all sweetness and affability!&quot;</p></div> </div>
