<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;No, ma&apos;am. What is it?&quot;</p><p> &quot;Something so strange! But you shall hear it all.&#x2014; When I got to Mr. Palmer&apos;s, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child. She was sure it was very ill&#x2014;it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples. So I looked at it directly, and, &apos;Lord! my dear,&apos; says I, &apos;it is nothing in the world, but the red gum&#x2014;&apos; and nurse said just the same. </p><p> But Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he stepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child, he said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy. </p></div> </div>
