<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;My dear,&quot; said she, entering, &quot;I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister. My poor husband! how fond he was of it! Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world. </p><p>&quot;Dear Ma&apos;am,&quot; replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the complaints for which it was recommended, &quot;how good you are! But I have just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me leave, I will drink the wine myself.&quot;</p></div> </div>
