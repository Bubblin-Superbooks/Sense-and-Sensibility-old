<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;I understand you.&#x2014;You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.&#x2014;For four months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.&#x2014; It was told me,&#x2014;it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph.&#x2014; This person&apos;s suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested;&#x2014;and it has not been only once;&#x2014;I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.&#x2014; I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.&#x2014;Nothing has proved him unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.&#x2014; I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister, and the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages.&#x2014; And all this has been going on at a time, when, as you know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness.&#x2014; If you can think me capable of ever feeling&#x2014;surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW. </p></div> </div>
